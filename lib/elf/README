This library contains code for working with elf-files.
It was copied from the Xen source tree.

  headers:        xen/includes/xen
  implementation: xen/common/libelf

The source should be basically like the __XEN__ form of the path
(i.e., no log file, as we don't have files in the basic environment).
Other changes include:
  * Removing unused code,
  * Additional validation to support potentially malformed ELF files.

This library is distributed under GPL becuase initially it was copied
from Xen, and as far as we understand this code is distributed under
the license described in the LICENSE file.
