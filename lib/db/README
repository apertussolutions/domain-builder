Xen Domain Builder README

This is a domain building library written in C.
It uses libc, libsmallOS, and libelf.

NOTE:  For the moment, the library expects that users
will provide a global variable called "pt_root", which
contains the virtual address of the top-most page table
strucutre.

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:

Just use "make", for the moment.

TO CLEAN:

> make clean
